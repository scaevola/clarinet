Plugins currently do not support all extension features and are most likely not going to in the future. Currently only `init_state` and `init_ops` are supported while `init_middleware` and `init_js` are not. Currently the `PluginResource` does not support being closed due to certain risks in unloading the dynamic library without unloading dependent functions and resources."]]});
